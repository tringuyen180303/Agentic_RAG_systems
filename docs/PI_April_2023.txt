This is for Piston Inline product
1. Series / pressure rating

PI – Piston-Inline flowmeter (the only series listed) 

2. Housing material (500 psi models) 

A – Aluminum - for lube-oil service

B – Brass - for water service

3. Housing material (1 500 psi models)

Z – 316 Stainless steel - for chemicals, corrosives and oil 

4. Internal moving parts

Z – 316L stainless steel (standard for water, oil, chemicals, corrosives) 

5. Seal material 

B – Buna-N: suited to water or mineral oil

F – Viton: suited to acids and some caustics

6. Maximum-flow scale codes (select the units you need) 

GH – gallons per hour (5 – 300 GPH choices)

GM – gallons per minute (0.25 – 30 GPM choices)

LH – liters per hour (20 – 1 000 LPH choices)

LM – liters per minute (5 – 100 LPM choices)

CMH – cubic meters per hour (1 – 6 m³/h choices)

GLM – dual scale, GPM & LPM

DGM – dual-viscosity scale (for two different fluids)

7. Threaded pipe connections (choose size and thread form) 

Nominal size	Code (NPT)	SAE	BSPP	BSPT	Max flow (GPM)
¼″	2	4T	4BP	4BT	5
⅜″	3	6T	6BP	6BT	10
½″	4	8T	8BP	8BT	15
¾″	6	12T	12BP	12BT	20
1″	8	16T	16BP	16BT	30

8. Flanged connections (example syntax)
2FWCS150RF = ¼″ pipe, F-welded, Carbon Steel, 150 lb ANSI raised-face flange. Size codes: 2 = ¼″, 4 = ½″, 6 = ¾″, 8 = 1″. 

9. Fluid-property block
Immediately after the flow-scale code you append your fluid’s viscosity and specific gravity:

format = [number][V/C/CS][SG]

V = SSU, C = centipoise, CS = centistokes

Example 32V1.0 → 32 SSU viscosity, SG = 1.0 

10. Optional extras (add after fluid block, separated by dashes) 

HT – high-temperature construction (to 400 °F)

HA – high-accuracy ±1 % FS (≥ 1 GPM ranges)

ST – stainless ID tag

TG – laminated safety-glass window

W / F – wall or foot mounting brackets

Putting it together – anatomy of the catalog’s sample code
PI-B Z F 10GM-4 32V1.0-HT decodes as:

PI – Piston-inline meter

B – Brass body (≤ 500 psi) for water

Z – 316L stainless internals

F – Viton seals

10GM – 10 GPM full-scale

-4 – ½″ NPT ports (code 4)

32V1.0 – 32 SSU, SG 1.0 calibration

-HT – high-temperature option enabled

Use this key to build or read any PI-series part number without needing the original chart.

The model code fragment shown on page 3—“A61 W L-HT-5D”—is really a miniature sentence, and every token in 
it can be swapped for another value listed in the same table:

Control-box + switch: A61 means the compact A-box fitted with one SPDT, 
3-wire, high-temperature switch. The identical switch can be ordered in the aluminium L-box or 
the 316 SS Z-box simply by replacing the prefix with L61 or Z61. 

Service rating: the next letter is the enclosure’s environmental seal.
 W = weather-proof (Type 4), but you may substitute N for oil-/dust-tight (Type 12) 
 or X for corrosion-proof (Type 4X) service. 

Flow direction: the single character after the 
service code fixes how the meter is mounted: R left-to-right, 
L right-to-left (used in the example), U up-flow or D down-flow. 

Special options block: everything between the dashes gathers “extras.” 
HT invokes the high-temperature package, but you could insert HA (±1 % high-accuracy), 
ST (stainless ID tag), TG (laminated safety-glass window), or the bracket codes W (wall) and F (foot). 

Switch set-point: the final field programs the SPDT’s actuation level. 
5D tells the factory to set the contact at 5 GPM on a declining-flow (“down”) condition; 
no other example values are shown, so the customer replaces “5” with any desired flow number and 
chooses D or U for falling or rising flow.
