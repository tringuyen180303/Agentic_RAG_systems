1 Series / pressure class
MN – “Normal” pressure, 300 psi (20.7 bar)

MM – Medium pressure, 500 psi (34.5 bar) – swap this for MN when you need the stronger 500-psi body.

MH – High pressure, 2 000 psi (138 bar) – swap this in when you need the 2 000-psi rating.

2 Housing material & flow-chamber liner
Code	Body / liner combination	Typical fluid
A	Aluminium body with nylon flow chamber	Lube-oil service
B	Brass body with nylon flow chamber	Water
D	Bare aluminium body (no nylon liner)	Lube oil
F	Bare brass body	Water
I	316 SS body	Chemicals & corrosives
M	Carbon-steel body	Oil

3 Internal moving parts (vane shaft, etc.)
I – 316-series stainless steel for corrosives

T – Titanium for sea-water duty

4 Seal material
B – Buna-N (NBR) for water or petroleum oils

F – Viton ® for acids, caustics or synthetic oils

K – Kalrez ® dynamic seals + Viton static seals for specialty or high-chem exposure

5 Maximum-flow scale codes (pick one, then choose a flow value printed in the catalog)
GM – U.S. gallons per minute (10 – 160 GPM choices)

LM – Litres per minute (40 – 600 LPM choices)

CMH – Cubic metres per hour (2.25 – 30 m³/h choices)

GLM – Dual GPM / LPM scale

DGM – Dual-viscosity GPM scale (for start-up vs. running viscosity)

LCD versions do not allow dual scales

6 Integral hand-operated globe valve (MN series only)
No letter = no valve

V = Brass globe valve built into the MN body
Only available on MN aluminium-or-brass housings with ports ≤ 1 in. and flow ≤ 30 GPM (50 GPM on 1½-in. housings). Not offered on carbon- or stainless-steel bodies.

7 Threaded port codes (size + thread form)
Nominal pipe size	NPT	SAE straight	BSPP	BSPT	Max flow*
½″	4	8T	8BP	8BT	25 GPM
¾″	6	12T	12BP	12BT	50 GPM
1″	8	16T	16BP	16BT	70 GPM
1¼″	10	20T	20BP	20BT	70 GPM
1½″	12	24T	24BP	24BT	100 GPM
2″	16	—	32BP	32BT	160 GPM
*Maximum flow is the highest standard range available for that port.		

8 Flanged connections
A flange block replaces the threaded-port digit and spells out:
[size] [F W|T] [CS|S] [class] [RF]

FW = weld-neck flange, FT = threaded flange

CS = carbon steel flange, S = 316 SS flange

150 / 300 = ANSI pressure class

RF = raised face
Example 4FTCS150RF → ½-in. threaded, carbon-steel, class-150, raised-face flange.

9 Fluid-property calibration block
After the flow-scale code you append viscosity + specific gravity:
[viscosity] [V|C|CS] [SG]

V = SSU, C = cP, CS = cSt

32ØV.9 means 320 SSU, SG 0.9

Dual viscosities use a slash: 32Ø/150V.9.

Putting it all together
A model string such as

MM-B I F 70GM-8-32ØV.9-V

decodes as:

MM – Medium-pressure (500 psi) series

B – Brass body with nylon chamber for water

I – 316 SS internals

F – Viton seals

70GM – 70 GPM maximum flow scale

-8 – 1-inch NPT ports

32ØV.9 – Calibrated at 320 SSU, SG 0.9

-V – Integral brass globe valve (MN/MM only)

Swap any of the highlighted tokens—MM for MN/MH, B for A/D/F/I/M, F for B/K, 70GM for any flow code, 8 for any port/flange code, V for “no valve,” etc.—to create the exact meter your application needs, confident that each replacement is defined in the catalog table.
